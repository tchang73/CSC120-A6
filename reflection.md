- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

My initial impressions of inheritance is that it is very useful when it comes to creating classes that are similar in the most parts but only different in details. It's fairly easy to add unique methods to individual child classes while still using the parent class's methods. I worked with a friend together on this assignment, which helped me grasp the concept clearer. I would recommend the same to someone taking this course in the future. Looking back at in-class example codes also helped a lot for this assignment.
